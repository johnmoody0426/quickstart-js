# Firebase Cloud Functions Sample: Moderated Guestbook

This sample demonstrates using Google Cloud Functions and its interaction with a Firebase DB through a simple Web UI.


## Introduction

This sample app is a Guestbook. Anyone can add messages using a Web UI.
A Server Side Cloud Function automatically moderates the messages (e.g. remove swearwords).

## Initial setup, build tools and dependencies

### 1. Install the Firebase CLI Alpha

You need to have installed [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) which typically comes with [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).

Download the [Firebase CLI 3.0.0 Alpha](https://developers.google.com/firebase/downloads/firebase-cli.3.0.0-alpha.latest.tar.gz) and install it using:

```
npm install -g firebase-cli.3.0.0-alpha.latest.tar.gz
```

> You might have to `sudo` the command above.

Run `firebase login` and authenticate with your Google account.


### 2. Clone this repo

Clone this repo and enter the `web/moderator-gcf` directory:

```bash
git clone sso://devrel/samples/firebase/quickstart/web
cd web/moderator-gcf
```


### 3. Create a Firebase project and configure the quickstart

Create a Firebase Project on the [Firebase Console](http://g.co/firebase).

Note your Firebase database URL and your App ID. You can find your Firebase database URL in the **Database** section. It will look like:
`https://<YOUR_APP_ID>.firebaseio.com/` Note your **App ID** and also the whole **Database URL**.

Use these values to replace `<APP_ID>` in `firebase.json` and the `<DATABASE_URL>` in `scripts/main.js`.
You can also do this automatically by running:

```bash
./setup.sh <DATABASE_URL>
```

For example: `./setup.sh https://functions-moderator-12345.firebaseio.com/`.


### 4. Enable the Google Cloud Functions APIs

Enable the Google Cloud APIs required to run Cloud Functions on your project:

 - Open [this page](https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=cloudfunctions,container,compute_component,storage_component,pubsub,logging)
 - Choose the project you created earlier and click **Continue**

Enable Billing on your project:

 - Open [this page](https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/settings)
 - Choose the project you created earlier and click **Continue**
 - Click **Enable Billing**
 - Select one of your **Billing accounts**. You may have to [create a Billing account](https://console.developers.google.com/billing/create) first.


## Start a local development server

You can start a local development server by running:

```bash
firebase serve
```

Then open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

You'll see a working Guestbook app. Simply add some messages and they should appear in a card below.

`firebase serve` only serves static assets locally at this point and the Cloud Functions haven't been deployed yet so they are not active. Once you've deployed the Cloud Function in the next step offensive messages will be moderated server side.


## Deploy the app to prod

Deploy to Firebase using the following command:

```bash
firebase deploy
```

This deploys the Web app on Firebase static hosting.
This also deploys and activate the Cloud Function which will moderate all your messages.

> The first time you call `firebase deploy` on a new project the Google Compute Engine instances and Kubernetes clusters required to run Cloud Functions will be spin-up. This may take a few minutes but things will be a lot faster on subsequent deploys.

Once the deploy succeeds your app is served from `https://<APP_ID>.firebaseapp.com`. Open the app using:

```bash
firebase open
```

On the Web UI offensive messages will now get moderated. For instance try to add "I DON'T LIKE THIS APP!!" this will get moderated to a - more civilized - non uppercase message: "I don't like this app.". Also messages containing swearwords (like "crap" or "poop") will also be moderated.


## Debugging

Within Cloud Functions any `console.log()` statements will be logged to Cloud Logging. You can view these logs by using [this Cloud Logging filter](https://console.developers.google.com/project/_/logs?advancedFilter=metadata.serviceName:"cloudfunctions.googleapis.com").

Alternatively, you can view logs locally by entering the following in your terminal from within your project's directory:

```bash
firebase functions:log [function-name]
```

Replace `function-name` with the name of the function you'd like to view logs for. You can add an optional `-f` flag to see logs as they are written.

> To view logs locally you'll need to have [gcloud](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) installed and have run `gcloud auth login`.
