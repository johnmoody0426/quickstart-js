Firebase Auth Quickstart
=============================

The Firebase auth quickstart demonstrates several methods for signing in.

The Firebase email/password quickstart demonstrates using a Firebase stored email & password - you can both create and sign in a user. 

The Firebase Google Sign in quickstart demonstrates using a Google account to authenticate to Firebase.

The Firebase Facebook Login quickstart demonstrates using a Facebook account to authenticate to Firebase.

The Firebase Anonymous auth quickstart demonstrates authenticate to Firebase anonymously.

The Firebase custom auth web quickstart demonstrates how to authenticate to Firebase with a user who has been authenticated from your own pre-existing authentication system. This is done by generating a token in a specific format, which is signed using the private key from a service account downloaded from the Google Developer Console. This token can then be passed to your client application which uses it to authenticate to Firebase.

Getting Started
---------------

- Set up your project on the [Firebase Console](http://g.co/firebase).
- Enable the authentication method you want to use in the Auth tab - you don't need to enable custom auth.
- In the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com), access the project you created in the Firebase Console. 
- For Custom Auth, also create a new Service Account, and download the JSON representation.
- For Google Sign In you will need to create a Web Client ID with a Javascript Origin field set to your domain (and/or localhost:5000).
- Edit the `.html` for the authentication method you want to try and copy the initialization snippet from **Auth > WEB SETUP** into the `<head>` section of `.html`.
- Run `firebase serve` using the Firebase CLI tool to launch a local server and open the sample `.html` in a web browser. Note that for Google Sign In you must use a webserver of some kind, file:// hosted pages wont work.
