Firebase Auth Quickstart
=============================

The Firebase auth quickstart demonstrates several methods for signing in.

The Firebase email/password quickstart demonstrates using a Firebase stored email & password - you can both create and sign in a user. 

The Firebase Google Sign in quickstart demonstrates using a Google account to authenticate to Firebase.

The Firebase Facebook Login quickstart demonstrates using a Facebook account to authenticate to Firebase.

The Firebase Anonymous auth quickstart demonstrates authenticate to Firebase anonymously.

The Firebase custom auth web quickstart demonstrates how to authenticate to Firebase with a user who has been authenticated from your own pre-existing authentication system. This is done by generating a token in a specific format, which is signed using the private key from a service account downloaded from the Google Developer Console. This token can then be passed to your client application which uses it to authenticate to Firebase.

Getting Started
---------------

- Set up your project on the [Firebase Console](http://g.co/firebase).
- Enable the authentication method you want to use in the Auth tab - you don't need to enable custom auth.
- In the [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com), access the project you created in the Firebase Console. 
- In the search box search for an select "Credentials" and create a Browser API key restricted to the domain you are using.
- For Custom Auth, also create a new Service Account, and download the JSON representation.
- For Google Sign In you will need to create a client ID with a Javascript Origin field set to your domain.
- Edit the .html for the authentication method you want to try and fill in the API key and Database URL values in index.html. You can see the database URL from the Database section on the Firebase Console.
- Open the sample `.html` in a web browser. Note that for Google Sign In you must use a webserver of some kind, file:// hosted pages wont work.
